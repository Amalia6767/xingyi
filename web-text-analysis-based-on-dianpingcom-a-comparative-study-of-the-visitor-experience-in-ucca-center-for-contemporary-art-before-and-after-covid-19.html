Being in this turbulent post-pandemic era, how to deal with change and what aspects should be improved have been the main questions. This paper takes UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, China as a case study. Through Web Text Analysis of comments on Dianping.com, from the visitors’ perspective to find out their different demands before and after COVID-19, and in a view of art management to evaluate if UCCA’s strategies match its aim. The results show that UCCA keeps up with the tide and respond to change fast, uses good “stunts” to attract audience, and builds close-knit relationship with customers. Although there are still problems unsolved, such as bad attitude of employees. Finally, advising on the sustainable development for art institutions. Namely, caring more about visitors’ inner world, reacting in time towards their feedback, utilizing some psychological tricks, and benefiting from locations. The most important is that all strategies established should be at one with their aim, and placing audience-oriented as priority.</p><p><strong>Keywords: </strong>Museum Experience; Visitor Studies; Art Institutions; Web Text Analysis; Strategy Evaluation.</p><p> </p><h4 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm4573l"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h4><p>Visitor studies have played a part in the sustainable development of museums since the twentieth century. Scholars investigated museum experience based on social, personal, and physical context (Falk &amp; Dierking, 1992), and visitors’ learning (Hein, 1998), attention (Bitgood, 2013), and expectation (Sheng &amp; Chen, 2012) using qualitative methods, such as narrative research (Everett &amp; Barrett, 2009), case studies, participatory observation, and interviews (Feng &amp; Lin, 2021), or quantitative methods including structural equation mode (Dirsehan, 2011), regression approach (Brida et al., 2016), or hybrid methodologies (Chandra, Cambria and Nanetti, 2020; Yi et al., 2022). Museums and galleries are different from other institutions since they have a consensus to consider, namely an accessible and inclusive not-for-profit institution that researches, collects, conserves, interprets and exhibits tangible and intangible heritage [1]. However, some researchers neglect this particularity, or only focused on visitors not interweaving their feedback with institutions’ strategy. Traditionally, humanities scholars rely on “close reading” [2] to gain information, which is meticulous but the results are lack of objectivity. Visitors’ demands are different and diverse (Falk, 2016), and research results vary by the sources and quantities of data, methodology, research context, and research perspectives. Authentic and scalable results need enormous data to verify.</p><p>In recent years, with the new push of big data, researchers started to use social medias to obtain research data and conduct researches combined with Text Analysis. Text Analysis or text mining are machine learning techniques that use natural language processing (NLP) to transform the unstructured data into structured data (Hotho et al., n.d.) for extracting specific words and phrases, trends, patterns, themes, and other features that are implicit but potentially useful from large information repositories (Han, Kamber, and Pei, 2011). While people in different countries have different applications preference. Western scholars tend to use Instagram (Chang et al., 2022) and twitter (Kydros et al., 2021) for finding behavior patterns (Lee, 2021) and opinions (Chandra, Cambria and Nanetti, 2020) of the public. Under the restrict of internet, researchers from China are inclined to choose WeChat (Gu &amp; He, 2021), Dianping.com (He et al., 2017) <em>,</em> XieCheng (Jiang &amp; Fu. 2020), TongCheng (Qin, 2022) to analyze attraction of tourism, education feedback, or use text analysis based on interviews content collected (Jordi et al., 2014). Most researchers analyzed comments data as a whole without considering the changes hidden inside that affected by time and the variables from outside (Emily &amp; Eric, 2011), especially from the influence of pandemic.</p><p>As a leading Chinese independent institution of contemporary art, UCCA Center for Contemporary Art or UCCA located at the heart of the 798 Art District in China still keeps attracting visitors while most museums’ audiences have declined a lot since the outbreak of COVID-19. This paper takes UCCA as a case study. Through Web Text Analysis of comments on Dianping.com, from the visitors’ perspective, to find out their different demands before and after COVID-19, evaluate if UCCA’s strategy matches its aim from a perspective of art management. Finally, advising on the sustainable development for art institutions. This article provides an alternative method for art managers to replicate the study using their preferred data and quickly analyze their own institutions.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the methodology applied. Sections 3 and 4 evaluate the results with analysis and suggestions for other art organizations. Section 5 is the discussion about the limitations of this study and the future work to be done.</p><h4 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm4573m"><strong>METHODOLOGY</strong></h4><h5 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm4573n"><strong>Choosing a Tool</strong></h5><p>Voyant is a user-friendly and versatile web-based application for performing text analysis, which is valuable for interpretative research to extract informative evidence through high-frequency terms, relative trends, and frequencies (Miller, 2018). It is employed for quantitative analysis of qualitative Marketing data (Hetenyi et al., 2019), extracting useful information, obtaining new insight from patient experience comments (Maramba et al., 2015), and conducting literatures analysis (Hodhod &amp; Fleenor, 2018). Voyan also has some drawbacks. It is affected by network conditions, and many functions are missing or cannot be customized, but it makes research feasible with minimal time consumed and no need for coding expertise, it is still a good supplementary tool for average humanities scholar (Welsh, 2014). For more stable and manageable tools, researcher can choose Wordless, AntConc, and other softwares.</p><h5 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm4573o">Data Acquisition and categorization</h5><p>The author collected data manually from Dianping.com which is literally "public reviews net", and hosts consumer reviews of restaurants, shops and various institutions, similar to Yelp and TripAdvisor. Considering this study’s research scope is comments analysis and users’ privacy, personal information was excluded, such as names, ages, and users’ profiles. In total, 3178 comments on Dianping.com were acquired. After deleting invalid comments that only contain a mark without words, or are unrelated to UCCA, 3155 valid comments were recorded. The time scale of this study is from 13<sup>th</sup> January 2010 when is the first comment of UCCA on Dianping.com to 4<sup>th</sup> August 2022. As for the time frame, although the official COVID-19 outbreak time is 1<sup>st</sup> December 2019, according to the specific close time for UCCA due to COVID-19, the time frame should be 30<sup>th</sup> January 2020 since there was a period of exhibition preparation and spring festival holiday. So, the corpus was divided into two Microsoft Excel documents.</p><h5 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm4573p">Data cleaning</h5><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/Figure-1.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-1-xs.png 300w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-1-sm.png 480w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-1-md.png 768w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-1-lg.png 1024w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-1-xl.png 1360w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-1-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="2720" height="1312"></figure><p><em>Figure 1. </em>The corpus before cleaning in OpenRefine.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/Figure-2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-2-xs.png 300w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-2-sm.png 480w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-2-md.png 768w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-2-lg.png 1024w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-2-xl.png 1360w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-2-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="2572" height="1240"></figure><p><em>Figure 2.</em> The corpus after cleaning in OpenRefine.</p><p>In Chinese language, some punctuations marks are different from English. Such as the comma is “,”, and the full stop is “。”. Some punctuations are unique, e. g. “《》”, “、”, “——”, and “[]”, etc. (Figure 1) Besides that, Chinese visitors combined multiple symbols to convey their special feelings, such as “~”, “*”, “!?!?”, “????”, and emojis etc. However, some Text Analysis tools designed for analyzing English corpus cannot identify these non-English symbols. In order to make sure the accuracy of the analysis results, The author used OpenRefine, an open-source desktop application for data cleanup to remove useless punctuations and symbols (Figure 2). The total words of comments corpus were 265,961 after cleaning, while they were 306,181 words before. And the comments after COVID-19 are 1591 with 136687 words, comments before that are 1563 with 129274 words, which are not very distinct.</p><h5 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm4573q">Voyant for Text Analysis</h5><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/Figure-3.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-3-xs.png 300w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-3-sm.png 480w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-3-md.png 768w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-3-lg.png 1024w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-3-xl.png 1360w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-3-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="3160" height="1590"></figure><p><em>Figure 3.</em> The interface after uploading the comments corpus on Voyant.</p><p>Voyant has twenty four tools to visualize the features of each document, or differences and relationship among several documents (Miller, 2018).

For example, “展览”, “展”, “画展” all mean “Exhibition” in English language. After obtaining top 100 words from Document Terms tool, the author summarized them to 80 words. Some terms refer to exhibition names: “The last judgement”, “Birth of a genius”, “Meditations in an emergency: Intermediate Status”, and “Staging the era” respectively, and artist names: Maurizio Cattelan, , Andy Warhol, and Cao Fei. Figure 4 reveals the high-frequency terms overall corpus, namely “Exhibition”, “Art”, “Artwork”, “UCCA”, “Picasso”, “Ticket”, “Artist”, “798”, etc. Art exhibitions mentioned the most, and followed by artwork, and artist. The audience tended to care about the whole situation more than details. Compared with other exhibitions in UCCA, “Picasso: Birth of a genius” was discussed the most, which means this exhibition is prominent among all, and it may also have had a pivotal influence on the popularity of UCCA in 798 art district or in China.</p><p>There are some implied actions showing visitors’ purposes or attention in UCCA, namely taking photos (photograph), buying art derivatives (buy), appreciating artworks (appreciation), learning from explanation (explain), and experiencing the “auro” in artworks and exhibitions (feeling and experience), etc. While some are complaints, such as some content cannot be understood (not understand), waste of time for queuing (queue), ticket prices or art derivatives were too expensive (expensive), and too cold because of air conditioner (cold), and so on. From the relative top terms, it is clear to know what visitors’ real concerns are and what aspects need to improve for UCCA.</p><h5 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm4573t">Distinctive terms</h5><p>Table 5</p><p><em>Distinctive terms of two documents</em></p><figure class="post__image align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/Figure-5.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-5-xs.png 300w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-5-sm.png 480w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-5-md.png 768w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-5-lg.png 1024w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-5-xl.png 1360w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-5-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="686" height="340"></figure><p>Figure 5 shows the results of distinctive words of two documents separately, which reveals their features and differences. The top 2 most frequently remarked words listed did not refer to exhibitions directly in text before COVID-19. In China, nearly all museums and galleries close on Monday. But, in the comments before COVID-19, the visitors shared much information about if UCCA opened on Monday, which reflected that UCCA did not have a stable or fixed time table. During “Picasso: Birth of a genius”, audiences needed to do security check before they came in exhibition halls, because Picasso’s artworks were all precious autographs from overseas museums. Besides that, “Classical”, “Abstract”, and “Masterpiece” are all about Picasso’s exhibition. The “Penguin” and “Books” refer to Penguin Random book cover design exhibition: “Here is where we meet”. And “Panda” refers to several artworks of an artist called Bandi Zhao who had a solo exhibition “Bandi Zhao’s China Party” in UCCA.</p><p>In terms of text after COVID-19, all terms are related to exhibitions directly except “COVID-19”, “Interactive” and “Sad”. “Banana”, “Specimen”, “Cake”, and “Tape” belongs to “The last judgement”. “Computer”, “AI”, and “Machine” refers to “Immaterial / Re-material: A Brief History of Computing Art”. Therefore, these two exhibitions were highly paied attention by visitors compared with other 10 exhibitions curated in UCCA after COVID-19. And people started to concern their connection with artworks and their inner world.</p><h5 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm4573u">Trends of ticket price</h5><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/Figure-6.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-6-xs.jpg 300w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-6-sm.jpg 480w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-6-md.jpg 768w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-6-lg.jpg 1024w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-6-xl.jpg 1360w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-6-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="681" height="391"></figure><p><em>Figure 6. </em>Relative frequencies of numbers.</p><p>Except for attraction of art, visitors talked about “Ticket” at 881 times (Figure 4), including a number of comments complained about high prices of tickets. In Figure 4, the numbers collected, namely 100, 60, 103, and 15, could be ticket prices. So, the prices need to be extracted and verified by another way.</p><p>The author used the Context Tool to search “元” (Chinese Monetary Unit), “票” (Ticket), and “票价” (Ticket Price), then collected the numbers around these three words. These prices mentioned by visitors in comments corpus from the lowest 10 RMB to the highest 190 RMB (Figure 6). Most prices set before were cut down now, and 100 RMB became the main price. While it was 15 RMB that was the majority prices before. Among these numbers, some refer to the same exhibition. For example, one exhibition has three different prices for students, children, and the elderly. Although the price fluctuates towards different exhibitions and time, it is still expensive among all art galleries and museums in China.</p><h5 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm4573v">Relative frequency of selected terms</h5><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/Figure-7.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-7-xs.jpg 300w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-7-sm.jpg 480w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-7-md.jpg 768w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-7-lg.jpg 1024w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-7-xl.jpg 1360w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-7-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1300" height="1300"></figure><p><em>Figure 7.</em> The relationships between terms and documents.</p><p>Figure 7 presents the relationships between selected terms and the documents. Each search term pulls documents toward it based on the term's relative frequency in the document. From the relative distance, it is obvious to see the changes of focus in visitors’ eyes. Photograph and interpretation are concerned all the time, and photograph is also one of the features of UCCA. The exquisite design and decoration of exhibitions have attracted plenty of visitors, especially the young to come. Before COVID-19, the audience cared more about artwork and exhibitions, and also the physical environment, namely the exhibition halls. While nowadays, they are inclined to focus on their own feelings, emotions, and the atmosphere, which means that the demands of visitors are getting more difficult to meet.</p><p>During the process of analyzing Chinese corpus, there was an issue on Voyant caused by dividing the complete and coherent corpus with contextualized meaning into numerous smaller words and phrases units (Krippendorff, 2018). For example, in Chinese language, except for using “no” and “not” directly to convey negation, there are plenty of different expression used in context can have the same meaning, which cannot be recognized by Voyant and other analysis tools. It cost more time and consideration for non-English Digital Humanities research project than English project.</p><h4 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm45740"><strong>EVALUATION AND CONCLUSION</strong></h4><p>From UCCA’s English website, they claim to be committed to the belief that art can deepen lives and transcend boundaries, while in Chinese website the slogan is “持续让好艺术影响更多人”, namely letting good artwork consistently influence more people. Combining these two key sentences, its ambition can be summarized to: curating inclusive and non-esoteric exhibitions to attract more people. However, it does not mean the content must be very understandable, inclusive exhibitions can mean that accepted by the public from multiple aspects, such as except for understand the explanation of artwork, there are chances for photograph and social as well. From the analysis results, it is easy to evaluate if UCCA is on its right track.</p><h5 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm45741">The features and changes of UCCA</h5><ul><li>Keep up with the tide and act fast<strong> </strong></li></ul><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/Figure-9.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-9-xs.jpg 300w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-9-sm.jpg 480w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-9-md.jpg 768w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-9-lg.jpg 1024w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-9-xl.jpg 1360w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-9-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="2000" height="1334"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/Figure-8-2.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-8-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-8-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-8-2-md.jpg 768w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-8-2-lg.jpg 1024w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-8-2-xl.jpg 1360w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-8-2-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="2000" height="1334"></figure><p><em>Figure 8 &amp; 9.</em> Photos of “Meditations in an Emergency” from <a href="https://ucca.org.cn/en/exhibition/meditations-in-an-emergency/">https://ucca.org.cn/en/exhibition/meditations-in-an-emergency/</a></p><p>While many museums and galleries were keeping their past style, UCCA has already adjusted its direction because of the changes outside, and carried out efficiently. After COVID-19, visitors left a lot of words containing “Think”, “Feeling”, “COVID-19”, “Meaning” (figure 10, 11, 12). They cared themselves more than before, which was affected by both pandemic and a group exhibition called “Meditations in an Emergency”. The exhibition name is from a poetry written by Frank O’Hara. “In times of crisis, we must all decide again and again whom we love”. This purpose of this exhibition was for comforting people, providing them a chance to reflect, and recalling their cohesion via art.</p><p>UCCA grabbed the sensitivity and visitors’ inner demands. It reacted immediately, and showed their inclusion and responsibility for society and people powerfully. Except for that exhibition, UCCA also curated other human-oriented exhibitions, such as “Immaterial / Re-material: A Brief History of Computing Art” and “Mirage: Contemporary Art in Augmented Reality” for exploring the relationship between humans and technologies. “Cao Fei: Staging the Era”, “Wang Tuo: Empty-handed into History”, and “Liu Xiaodong: Your Friends” which were all about how humans acted in different era.</p><ul><li>Magnify “one point” of each exhibition</li></ul><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/Figure-10.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-10-xs.jpg 300w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-10-sm.jpg 480w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-10-md.jpg 768w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-10-lg.jpg 1024w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-10-xl.jpg 1360w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-10-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="3400" height="700"></figure><p><em>Figure 10</em>.

Audience would visit an exhibition because of the “one point”, such as “the most famous artwork”, “the biggest exhibition yet”, “the first exhibition”, or “the most expensive artwork”, and other stunts that sounded rarely and preciously. In figures 10 and 11, each selected word is represented as a bubble with the size of the bubble indicating the word’s frequency in the document. The larger the bubble the more frequently the word occurs.</p><p>During exhibition “The last judgement”, the highest count term is “Banana”, which refers to an expensive artwork called “Comedian” created by Maurizio Cattelan, and sold at 12 million dollars in 2019 when the expensive “Banana” was bound on the wall by a tape. So, the distinctive term “Tape” was mentioned 34 times (Figure 5). The “Cake” is a banana cake designed by Holyland that is one of the most popular cake brands in China. UCCA had a cooperation with it, which was to sale banana cakes that were very similar to the “Banana” created by Cattelan. Another example is “Picasso: Birth of a genius”, the first Picasso exhibition in China. Visitors mentioned 294 times “真迹” (Autograph). It proved that they cared about the authenticity of artwork, and were eager to become one of the first watchers of Picasso’s exhibition in China. What a memorable experience!  Many people have been attracted by “one point” highlighted by UCCA on purpose.</p><ul><li>Building close-knit relationship with customers</li></ul><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/Figure-12.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-12-xs.jpg 300w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-12-sm.jpg 480w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-12-md.jpg 768w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-12-lg.jpg 1024w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-12-xl.jpg 1360w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-12-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1500" height="1293"></figure><p><em>Figure 12</em>.

Thus, UCCA encouraged people to join in UCCA club via offering them another more “economical” plan. In order to see the changes in prices, the author separated the decreased prices and the increased prices. After COVID-19, some prices that were too cheap, such as 10 RMB, 15 RMB, and 30 RMB, or too expensive, such as 188 RMB, 158 RMB, and 150 RMB were cut down. The trends in Figure 11 shows that UCCA has arranged its price setting after COVID-19. It narrowed down choices of ticket prices, and adjusted tickets at a price of 100 RMB. Except for some famous artist’s exhibition, such as “Becoming Andy Warhol”: 190 RMB for an adult, and 140 RMB for a student.</p><p>A membership costs 500 RMB for an adult, and 800 RMB for a couple per year, including visiting all exhibitions except special programs. From comments, massive visitors introduced others to join in UCCA club because think thought that was very cheaper. If you visit UCCA more than 5 times a year, joining in membership is a good choice compared with buying tickets separately. But at the same time, the original prices are still not cheap. UCCA just provided another seemly better choice for the audience. Admittedly, it is a good way to nurture regular customers at the same time, and people also love to do.</p><h5 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm45742">The improved and unsolved problems of UCCA</h5><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/Figure-14.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-14-xs.png 300w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-14-sm.png 480w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-14-md.png 768w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-14-lg.png 1024w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-14-xl.png 1360w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-14-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="964" height="730"></figure><p><em>Figure 14. </em>The frequency and distribution of terms: “Cold”, and “Air conditioner”.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/Figure-15.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-15-xs.png 300w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-15-sm.png 480w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-15-md.png 768w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-15-lg.png 1024w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-15-xl.png 1360w, https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-15-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="960" height="720"></figure><p><em>Figure 15.</em> The frequency and distribution of terms: “Body guard”, “employees”, and “workers”.</p><p>There are different problems existed in different period, but two problems are talked all the time. Namely, the bad attitude of employees especially of body guards, and too cold inside due to air conditioner. In figures 14 and 15, each document in the corpus is represented as a vertical block where the height of the block indicates the relative size of the document compared to others in the corpus. The location of occurrences of search terms is located as red blocks.</p><p>In figures 14, the problem of cold has been improved after COVID-19 because the red points decreased a lot, namely less complaints about that issue. However, in terms of the attitude, red points spread regularly in both documents, which means that problem remains until now. It reflected that UCCA had not token measures to solve this problem, or its solutions did not work too much. From the perspective of audience, UCCA’s employees need to improve their work profession and attitude. This problem may be caused by reason of many workers are volunteers or internship, thus, their performances cannot be guaranteed.</p><h5 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm45743">Suggestions for art institutions</h5><p>Employing strategies or tricks do not mean non-professional, especially for traditional museums and galleries. This visitor comments analysis of UCCA indirectly reflects its marketing and branding strategies from which art institutions may have inspiration. Such as taking advantages of innovation to help them respond to changes, changing the themes and design of exhibitions, making use of various social medias for advertising, building a solid relationship with audience, and cooperating with KOL (Key Opinion Leader) or celebrities. In post-pandemic era, people are more vulnerable, and art institutions need to pay more attention to visitors’ emotion that can also stimulate learning (John &amp; Katie 2009), and their inner demands. Therefore, some necessary “tricks” of user psychology for triggering audiences’ motivation of visiting are needed. For non-profit institutions who have financial issues, asking for help from outside can be helpful, but that cannot last forever. Thus, it is also urgent and important to find a sustainable way to save themselves from UCCA’s experience.</p><p>Another suggestion is about taking advantage of location and surroundings. In the past, visitors mentioned "798" more than "UCCA". At that time, some visitors came to 798 art district to travel, then visited UCCA by the way. Some also went to visit UCCA because there were also many other entertainments, such as coffee shops, book stores, and restaurants in 798 art district that they could visit together. UCCA had a strong connection with 798, and relied on it. However, with time passing by, people tend to say UCCA rather than 798 art district, which reveals that the audience focused on UCCA itself more. Nowadays, as a symbol of 798 art district, its uniqueness becomes more and more acceptable. Therefore, it is necessary to think about the merits of location for both new and old art institutions. And also utilizing the benefits around them.</p><h4 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm45744"><strong>DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK</strong></h4><p>This research used web text analysis to understand visitors’ experience in UCCA based on comments from Dianping.com, and interpreted the trends and differences before and after COVID-19, evaluated if UCCA’s strategies matched with its aim, and also advised for other art institutions. As a result of analysis, it shows that timely changes and strategies are very important during pandemic or in post-pandemic era. The strategies should be at one with the art institution’s aim, and make the audience-oriented as priority. When the variation of outside environment and demands of audience, it is also necessary to adjust the strategies. This article demonstrates a new way for art managers to understand museum visitor studies. The method can be replicated by researchers to analyze their own institutions. Because the comments are increasing by time, and the visitors will have changes in ages, mindsets, and preference (Black, 2015), it is also suggested that researchers conduct a longitudinal study to observe changes in visitor experiences in the study over time.</p><p>There are some limitations in this study. The data collected is limited by this single data resource of Dianping.com. If time allows, the corresponding research should widely use a variety of social media data such as Sina Weibo, WeChat, etc., combined with multi-source data, so as to more comprehensively to understand the visitors. In addition, this study only focused on web text excluding other categories of visitors, such as kids, the elderly, and others who do not own a smartphone or not use Dianping.com. Future research could combine online reviews and questionaires, quantitative and qualitative analysis to build a more solid foundation for results (Hetenyi et al., 2019). Lastly, Dianping.com is a commercial platform, inevitably, there are some unknown fake comments that are for commercial profit, both good or bad on, which can have an influence on the results. And the quantity of data can also affect the analysis. Thus, more data resources and more data are needed in the future for obtaining more precise and scientifical results.</p><p>Last but not least, there is no universally correct way to measure if the museum or gallery is successful. The numbers of visitors, annual income, quantifying its reputation, or examining its approval from peers cannot decide its success. The only criterion is their aim, and if they care about the public. We do not need to make every visitor happy, but we do need visitors to come, which is the reason why art organizations and we as art employees exist.</p><p> </p><hr><h4 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm45745"><strong>FOOTNOTES</strong></h4><p>[1] Close reading is a thoughtful, critical analysis of a text that focuses on significant details or patterns in order to develop a deep, precise understanding of the text’s form, craft, meanings, etc. <a href="https://nieonline.com/tbtimes/downloads/CCSS_reading.pdf">https://nieonline.com/tbtimes/downloads/CCSS_reading.pdf</a></p><p>[2] A new museum definition approved by ICOM on August 24, 2022.
