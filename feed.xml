                <p class="align-left">Why information is dangerous when there is no higher purpose that it serves? I was puzzled while reading his book “Technopoly: the Surrender of Culture to Technology”, Postman illustrates his worries about the influence of technology. The worst situation is the culture takes its orders from technology and we live in a TECHNOPOLY world. So, can we find the solution and stop this happen?</p>
<p class="align-left">From my experience in a Virtual Reality company, I knew the necessity of digitalization, which is providing a choice for people to “feel” the world in a distant way. After transforming the exhibitions I curated into virtual ones, I found people excited at the beginning of the experience, but they will not click the button again. Same as I volunteered for guiding students from remote areas to appreciate art exhibitions through virtual tours. They thought it cool but they were not interested in browsing VR exhibitions by themselves. In Design Thinking class, I tried to convert my way of thinking. I investigated my four nieces and nephews about why they wanted to go to museums. Their innocent and simple answers which were for playing not studying were far away from what I thought but reasonable. In retrospect, I focused too much on the technology’s performance and my own limited perspective but ignored the more important views from outside.</p>
<p class="align-left">According to Christoph Kucklick, we are living in “die granulare Gesellschaft” (the granular society) and we can be analyzed by numerous data that can predict our behaviors. Every piece of information that people post online will be part of their identities in the era of data explosion. Nonetheless, this situation is inevitable, we can take control of the purpose of using data. For analyzing the strategies of Guardian Art Center, I collected the themes of all its articles on WeChat manually and make it visualization to estimate if its actual strategies match its micro goal in Art Museum Planning class. This is my first time viewing a problem from a digital perspective which helped me get a 95 score. Except for qualitative methods, we can discover new kinds of problems or special features which cannot be perceived easily by humans through data or machine learning. So that we can improve the actual strategy and design more targeted services for visitors.</p>
<p class="align-left">While learning Digital Humanities at Oxford University summer school and UCLA Digital Humanities Summer Workshop online, I learned about various projects led by scholars from different countries, such as “Remember Me” in memory of people who died as a result of COVID-19 in the UK. And I learned more about digital tools such as ArcGIS, OpenLayers, and Voyant. I realized that the definition of Digital Humanities itself might become a kind of limitation. The point is what meaning I want to convey and how I make it using digital tools. After webinars, I focused on Web Text Analysis and taught myself to use Wordless and Voyant which are both for Natural Language Processing. I got the Professional Certificate of Text Analytics with Python tutored by computational linguist Jonathan Dunn for understanding how Natural Language Processing works and how to collect data using Python. All of the means are to help me find the characteristic of visitors online. Information from the internet cannot cover all kinds of people, so qualitative methods are still necessary and research should base on ethics.</p>
<p class="align-left">The question from the beginning is always on my mind and I think the higher purpose is a human-oriented purpose. When I launch a Digital Humanities project in the Research Center for Digital Humanities, Renmin University of China. The first and foremost is setting a higher purpose, namely analyzing information extracted from social media to find out what visitors care about and want so that museums can design services and satisfy them better. This project provides a description of different art activities in Beijing for users to choose their art routes, and they can write down their comments below the activity and share them. This interactive map will record their tracks and information, which is useful to analyze their behaviors’ characteristics in time and space. Through this interdisciplinary cooperation project, I learned how to work with people from different backgrounds and learn from their concepts.</p>
<p class="align-left">Postman reminds us of the purpose of using technology by criticizing technology sharply. In the last chapter of the book, he has told us the right direction of facing TECHNOPOLY. Namely, by joining art and science as well as the past and the present to create a continuous story of a human, aiming to achieve “the ascent of humanity”. If only choose one word to describe my uniqueness, I would say “iteration”. I always reflect on what I did, learn from the past and readjust myself. This consistent “program” of mine can help me accomplish my academic research and achieve my goal of being a Digital Humanist in the future to solve human problems using digital tools under the principle of being human-oriented and try to be one of “The Loving Resistance Fighters”, and always keeping the higher purpose in my deep heart.   </p>
