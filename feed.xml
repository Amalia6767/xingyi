<p class="align-center">Simon Mahony, Xingyi Chen, Puyu Wang</p>
<p><strong>Abstract </strong>  Digital humanities, as an active promoting force of the Open Agenda, shares the same core values with Open Science: freedom, collaboration, inclusion, sharing, openness, and transparency. Digital technologies not only provide the technical foundation for realizing freedom, openness, and sharing, but they also transformed human thinking and the paradigms of scientific research. The widespread application of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, has exerted a significant impact on the disciplinary literacy, research paradigms, and trends of digital humanities.</p>
<p>Simon Mahony, Emeritus Professor of Digital Humanities at University College London (UCL), has been active in the field for over 20 years. As a contributor, researcher, and educator in digital humanities, he analyzes the development of this field from a comprehensive perspective. Through three in-depth interviews with Professor Mahony, this article discusses the spirit of openness in digital humanities, starting from the Open Agenda and Open Science, with a particular focus on the development and future of digital humanities in the era of artificial intelligence. By conducting a comparative analysis of domestic and international discussions surrounding the Open Agenda, this article aims to uncover the various focal points and its potential development in China, providing new perspectives for digital humanities’ spirit of openness and exploring its expansive prospects in the new era.</p>
<p><strong>Keywords</strong> Digital humanities; Open Agenda; Open Science</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1i9ogeo3s7d"><strong>0 Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>On November 23, 2021, UNESCO released the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science[1], which defines open science as an integrated and inclusive framework combining movements and practices, aiming to achieve open access, use and reuse of scientific knowledge, promote scientific and social development by strengthening scientific cooperation and information sharing, and share the production, evaluation and dissemination of scientific knowledge with other groups in society that were not previously included in the scientific community. Since its inception, digital humanities has been a firm advocate of the spirit of openness. It shares the concepts of cooperation, inclusiveness, sharing, openness and transparency with open science. It is the most compatible field in humanities scholarship and is closely related to the birth of the concept of "Open Agenda". The concept of "Open Agenda" originated from the convergence of multiple movements that aim to democratize knowledge and make academic research more inclusive and transparent. These movements include open access[2], open science<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, participatory culture[3] and digital humanities[4], all of which advocate sharing of knowledge and public participation in the research process.</p>
<p>The open agenda covers the transformation of publishing models, the trend of promoting free and open release of research results, and the impact of these initiatives on the academic community. For the open agenda, foreign academic circles have formed a relatively systematic research framework and theoretical system [5,6,7,8,9,10], while domestic research on this topic is still in its early stages and there is a lack of relevant academic literature. In the field of digital humanities, Simon Mahony, Professor Emeritus of Digital Humanities at University College London (UCL), has extensive research experience in open publishing, open data and digital humanities. He delivered a keynote speech entitled "Open Agenda: Open Access Publishing" at the 2022 Beijing Forum, and delivered a keynote speech entitled "Open Agenda: Open Access, Open Publishing and Open Science" at seminars at Renmin University of China, University of Nottingham Ningbo, China, and Zhejiang University. Professor Simon Mahoney is able to analyze the open agenda from multiple perspectives, including policy, technology, and academic culture, and provides a unique and comprehensive perspective on this topic, especially around the connection between open publishing and research methods, the challenges and opportunities of promoting open practices, and the practice of open agenda initiatives in Europe and the UK<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Professor Mahoney has not only played a key role in the construction and development of UCL Digital Humanities, but has also held important positions in many universities and research institutions such as Beijing Normal University (Zhuhai) and Peking University, accumulating rich experience in digital humanities research and education. As a member of the Digital Humanities Curriculum Design Committee of the iSchools Alliance and a member of many international academic institutions, Professor Mahoney has unique insights and rich practical experience in promoting openness and innovation in the field of digital humanities. Through an interview with Professor Mahoney, we hope to showcase the basic issues and development status of the open agenda in the field of digital humanities, so as to promote relevant discussions in China.</p>
<p>Simon Mahony, male, Professor Emeritus of Digital Humanities at University College London, Visiting Professor in the Department of Information Management Department at Peking University. His research focuses on digital humanities with specific interests in education, communication, information studies, digital storytelling, equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI), and the open agenda. His representative works include "The Open Agenda: Why Openness and Transparency Are Needed" (2022); "Towards Openness and Transparency to Better Facilitate Knowledge Creation" (2022); " Language and the Subjects of Study in the Digital Humanities" (2020); "Language and Cultural Hegemony in Digital Humanities" (2019), etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1i9ogeo3s7e"><strong>1 Open Agenda and Open Science</strong></h2>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i9ogjbkdas"><strong>Q1: What is the definition and content of the “open agenda” and how does it relate to “open science”?</strong></h3>
<p>A: For me, the open agenda means that everything is open, as open as possible, but closed when necessary because some content may be sensitive or confidential and subject to data protection laws. The open agenda includes open education, open access, open data and open science, and perhaps open peer review and open source. These are all part of the same movement towards openness and transparency.</p>
<p>In my opinion, open science simply means open scholarship. I have a classical education background and my roots are in the humanities. The word “science” can be extracted from the Latin word “scientia”, which means knowledge, and thus is similar to the word “scholarship”, in the broadest sense, including all humanities, social sciences and other academic fields. An example is the European Open Science Cloud [11], which was established to store all European research data without any distinction.</p>
<p>I would avoid defining something and support inclusiveness rather than strict divisions into specific academic fields, which may lead to exclusion between disciplines. This inclusive approach can promote our collaborative work with multiple disciplines. In short, open science is part of the open agenda.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i9ogjbkdat"><strong>Q2: When did you start paying attention to the issue of the "open agenda"? Is it related to your digital humanities research?</strong></h3>
<p>A: Before working at UCL, I worked at the Humanities Computing Center (now the Digital Humanities Department) at King's College London (KCL). Before the widespread use of virtual learning environments (VLEs), the Humanities Computing Center had servers independent of KCL's institutional infrastructure for project hosting, and some of the server space was dedicated to storing teaching materials. I was teaching undergraduate and postgraduate courses at the time, and all teaching materials were hosted there. These materials are also stored on the open network without logging in - anyone who knows the URL can access them, and these materials are available until the server is updated. Because it is my own intellectual achievement, any images used are also mine or in the public domain, so there are no copyright issues. At the same time, I was also responsible for the operation of an online master's program and was very familiar with copyright and intellectual property issues. This is how I learned to develop publicly hosted online teaching materials, which also involved intellectual property issues.</p>
<p>But when I moved to UCL, I found that this openness was not common, and students needed to log in through the institution to access my teaching materials. A few years later, UCL, King's College London and many other universities began to use Moodle (https://moodle.org/) as a course management tool and teaching material hosting platform. In 2011, a colleague introduced and recruited me to participate in the creation of open educational resources funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee of the United Kingdom. So I participated in the development of the "Open Educational Resources for Digital Humanities Project" project. This sparked my research interest in open education, and within a few years I held workshops and conference presentations with colleagues, which made me more aware of the open agenda.</p>
<p>For me, the open agenda starts with education, that is, making my teaching materials openly available to anyone who wants to access it. I will do my best to make all my intellectual achievements free under the Creative Commons Licence.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i9ogjbkdau"><strong>Q3: What attempts have you made to promote the open agenda in your teaching and research, such as your UCL, what is this process?</strong></h3>
<p>A: I promote the open agenda and emphasize its importance in my teaching, guest lectures, and keynote speeches. I have also published articles specifically on this topic [12,13] and have presented the principles of the open agenda in articles on other related topics. I am also a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Open Humanities Data<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, which is fully open access, and a member of the advisory board of Panta Rei<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>, the digital journal of historical sciences and teaching at the University of Murcia, which is also fully open access.</p>
<p>Going towards openness requires a cultural change within academic institutions, and I am glad that UCL is leading the way in this regard. For example, the first university press in the UK to go fully open access was UCL Press<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>, and indeed the URL of the UCL Library<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>’s open access page includes the term “open science”.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i9ogeo3s7f"><strong>2 Open Agenda and Digital Humanities</strong></h3>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i9ogjbkdav"><strong>Q4: Is there a specific open agenda for digital humanities? Or is the “open agenda” universal and does not vary by research field?</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
<p>A: As mentioned above, it seems to me that digital humanities are advocates of the open agenda. In the UK, we support open access and open publishing, encourage all scholars to publish openly, and only articles published in open access form will be included in the Research Excellence Framework, a system used to assess the research quality of UK universities. The various aspects of the open agenda and how to participate in it may vary from research field to research field, but fundamentally it is about openness and transparency.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i9ogjbkdb0"><strong>Q5: Is the open agenda particularly important for the digital humanities field? In turn, what can digital humanities do for open science?</strong></h3>
<p>A: In turn, it seems that - in the West, I cannot speak for other regions - digital humanities have become strong advocates of the open agenda. Most of us try to make everything open (such as a large number of open access digital humanities publications), but unfortunately, this is not always possible.</p>
<p>For example, open access publishing requires funds to pay for article processing charges (APCs). This is disadvantageous for junior scholars who do not have funding, and scholars from institutions with less funding. When I was working at Beijing Normal University, I used my research grant to pay for APCs, but I am currently affiliated with University College London as an emeritus professor (retired status), so I cannot get funding for this. So this also means that the remaining articles under review in my contract with Beijing Normal University will not be published publicly. Because my contract with Beijing Normal University stipulates that they must be published in SSCI/SCI/A&amp;HCI journals, which all require APCs for public publication.</p>
<p>I hope that all future articles will be submitted to open access journals and journals without APCs, regardless of their status in the Clarivate Web of Science list. For me, open access publishing is more important than SSCI, etc. See also my articles "Towards openness and transparency to better promote knowledge creation" [12] "Open agenda: Why openness and transparency are needed" [13].</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i9ogjbkdb1"><strong>Q6: Can you introduce the development of the open agenda for digital humanities in different regions that you have observed, such as the characteristics and difficulties faced, and the reasons behind them?</strong></h3>
<p>A: Any new thing always brings problems and objections. For example, for open educational resources, our research shows that copyright is a major issue, as teachers often share materials without necessarily knowing where they came from. There are similar objections to open access publishing and open data - I mentioned this in my article, but both seem to have become standard practice in the West because people can see the benefits - more people read your publications, data can be reused. The Journal of Open Humanities Data is part of Ubiquity Press<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>, where we publish research papers and short data papers to complement full papers and promote open datasets with the goal of making them available for reuse. UCL Press also makes all content available for free download as PDF.</p>
<p>UK universities require faculty to publish openly, and only open access papers are included in assessments and count towards staff promotions. Major funders such as UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and the Wellcome Trust<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> also require that research data from projects they fund be made public.</p>
<p>The situation in China is slightly different, but China has taken some steps to emphasize the importance of open access publishing and open data. UNESCO has a publication on open educational resources<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> in the People’s Republic of China and a global open access portal. The National Science Foundation of China has also issued a Policy Statement on the Implementation of Open Access to Publicly Funded Research Papers<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>, which states that the results of publicly funded research belong to the whole society and should be freely available. Similarly, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has a plan to achieve large-scale open access to journal articles. Several top Chinese universities, such as Peking University and Tsinghua University, are developing open data repositories. The Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license is now available in both simplified and traditional Chinese to address differences with Western regions and cultures[14].</p>
<p>New initiatives are always bound to encounter opposition, but there is now a growing awareness of the value of open access publications and the data on which they are based.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i9ogjbkdb2"><strong>Q7: Outside of academia, there are many commercial companies engaged in digital humanities-related work, and there are also many non-professional enthusiasts working on various digital humanities projects. How will they affect the open agenda? What role do they play in the field of digital humanities as a whole?</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
<p>A: Commercial companies play an important role in digital humanities research - we need collaboration, especially in areas such as imaging, immersive virtual reality, and the metaverse. These are areas where commercial development is not necessarily available to university staff. For example, the UCL Digital Humanities Imaging Lab has equipment provided by commercial companies for imaging manuscripts and precious documents, and these companies also provide training. I have also worked with the Digital Humanities group at the Shanghai Library, and they have also worked with many commercial companies, such as the equipment and systems in the new East Library of the Shanghai Library. Similarly, large infrastructure initiatives often rely on commercial platforms for development.</p>
<p>Non-professional enthusiasts, what we call “citizen science” or “citizen-science”, also make a huge contribution to research initiatives. Think of the many crowdsourcing projects that rely on volunteer work, such as the UCL Transcribe Bentham<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> project and Zooniverse. Much work in the cultural heritage field is also undertaken by actively engaged members of the public<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>.</p>
<p>There are countless possibilities for both commercial applications and citizen science in the open agenda. Citizen science platforms are inherently open and can be accessed by anyone. Commercial products also allow for the public release of research materials, provided that the work is carried out by university or museum staff.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i9ogjbkdb3"><strong>Q8: Now more and more humanities scholars are trying to use generative AI such as ChatGPT to assist in research, including basic work such as building databases, data annotation, and data analysis. Do you think it will replace the common tools currently used in the field of digital humanities? Will it become a development trend in digital humanities research in the future? Can it be considered a change that will occur within digital humanities? What impact will this have on the open agenda?</strong></h3>
<p>A: This is a difficult question to answer, and only time will tell us what impact it will have. I don't know if any scholars are using generative AI to do basic work such as databases, data annotation, and data analysis. Generative AI relies on the data it can access, which usually comes from the Internet or training data sets. I have used ChatGPT, but the output answers are more general and lack a certain depth, so I haven't used it for other more in-depth research.</p>
<p>In my opinion, artificial intelligence should be part of information literacy teaching. Rather than showing what it can do, it is more important to focus on what it can't do. It can be part of the educator's toolkit, not part of the researcher's toolkit. Because an important issue for all generative AI and AI more generally is trust (or lack of trust). This is clearly stated in the European Commission’s White Paper (2020): On Artificial Intelligence – A European Approach to Excellence and Trust<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>. The European Parliament’s Artificial Intelligence Act (2024)<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> , and the UK Department for Science, Innovation and Technology’s Artificial Intelligence Regulation: A Pro-Innovation Approach<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>. In China, the Interim Measures for the Administration of Generative AI Services, which came into effect in August 2023, focus almost entirely on generative AI<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1i9ogjbkdb4"><strong>Q9: You have talked about the open agenda on many occasions, so are you optimistic or pessimistic about the development of the open agenda in digital humanities? What are the current and future factors that affect this process?</strong></h3>
<p>A: As mentioned above, we now see and understand the benefits of the open agenda. Overall, I am optimistic, but the concept needs to be accepted and supported by the academic community and publishers. The previous model was that scholars needed to pay for publishing, and then university libraries had to pay subscription fees to access these publications, but this model is gradually becoming ineffective. At the same time, we need to be clear that those of us who are in universities or associated with academic institutions are in a privileged position. Open access and open data are different from universal access. There is still a digital divide between the rich and the poor in terms of access, such as the lack of or high cost of internet access in many areas. There are many other issues that hinder universal access, such as language issues, accessibility to publish papers or data online, connectivity - not everywhere has the same connectivity as we do, and content filtering and blocking.</p>
<p>In addition, we live in an era where the Internet needs to be protected from corporate interests. Those who seek to divide us rather than unite us for their own personal ends; those whose aim is to manipulate public opinion and make us doubt our knowledge and understanding of a situation, thereby causing confusion. These are the dangers we face in an Internet society. Openness and transparency in education are key. When we write articles or produce data, we must be clear about the sources of evidence we use to support any point of view. Therefore, we need complete and transparent documentation so that we can be confident in the information and data. We must also be prepared to question the authenticity and reliability of the information we provide, looking for evidence of potential bias, conflicts of interest, and balanced views.</p>
<p>Digital humanities provide us with key tools to do this, and digital tools and digital literacy should be a core part of every academic course.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Since the outbreak of COVID-19, museums have been closed frequently, encountering problems such as loss of audience and financial crisis. In the turbulent post-pandemic era, how to deal with changes and what aspects need to be improved have become the main problems they face. This paper takes UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing, China, as an example, using web text analysis from comments of audiences on Dianping.com, combined with UCCA’s goal to analyze its micro-strategy, transformation of strategies, and the effects of transformation. Moreover, this paper reveals the changes in visitors’ focus and remaining problems of UCCA before and after COVID-19. The results show that UCCA used a more economical membership mechanism to establish close relationships with audiences, which made the complaints of high-price tickets less. Before the pandemic, the audience focused on the content of exhibitions, however, after that, the demands of audiences became more abstract and they tend to talk about their feelings and emotions generated from exhibitions. Meanwhile, UCCA switched its exhibition themes to be more related to the times and people to communicate with the audience more deeply. In a post-pandemic era, on-site studies sometimes are restricted in China, while studying museum visitors based on acquiring data from social media is relatively steady. Meanwhile, the paper provides a method for art managers to replicate the study that can be used for analyzing their institutions.</p>

<h4 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm4573l"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h4>
<p>Visitor studies have played a part in the sustainable development of museums since the twentieth century. Scholars investigated museum experience based on social, personal, and physical context , visitors’ learning (Hein, 1998), attention (Bitgood, 2013), and expectation (Sheng &amp; Chen, 2012) using qualitative , such as narrative research (Everett &amp; Barrett, 2009), case studies, participatory observation, and interviews (Feng &amp; Lin, 2021), or quantitative methods, including structural equation mode (Dirsehan, 2011), regression approach (Brida et al., 2016), or hybrid methodologies (Chandra, Cambria, and Nanetti, 2020; Yi et al., 2022). Museums are different from other institutions since they have a consensus to serve as not-for-profit institutions that research, collect, conserve, interpret, and exhibit tangible and intangible heritage①. However, some researchers neglect this particularity or only focus on visitors, not interweaving their feedback with institutions’ strategies. In addition, humanities scholars rely on “close reading”②. to gain information traditionally, which is meticulous but leads to a lack of objectivity in results. Visitors’ demands are different and diverse (Falk, 2016), and research results vary by the sources and quantities of data, methodology, research context, and research perspectives. Authentic and scalable results need enormous data to verify.</p>
<p>In recent years, with the new push of big data, researchers started to use social media to obtain information and conduct research combined with text analysis. Text Analysis or text mining are machine learning techniques that use natural language processing (NLP) to transform unstructured data into structured data (Hotho et al., n.d.) for extracting specific words and phrases, trends, patterns, themes, and other implicit features from large information repositories (Han, Kamber, and Pei, 2011). While people in different countries have different applications preference. Western scholars tend to use Instagram (Chang et al., 2022) and Twitter (Kydros et al., 2021) for finding behavior patterns (Lee, 2021) and opinions (Chandra, Cambria, and Nanetti, 2020) of the public. Researchers from China are inclined to choose WeChat (Gu &amp; He, 2021), Dianping.com (He et al., 2017)<em>,</em> Ctrip (Jiang &amp; Fu, 2020), and Mafengwo ( to analyze the attraction of tourism, education feedback, or to use text analysis based on collected interviews content (Jordi et al., 2014). Meanwhile, the audience is affected by outside variables, such as social environment and disasters, therefore, it is necessary to consider the changes in context inside the comments (Emily &amp; Eric, 2011).</p>
<p>UCCA Center for Contemporary Art founded by collectors Guy and Myriam Ullens is committed to the belief that art can deepen lives and transcend boundaries. More than one million visitors come to visit each year. According to the “Art’s Most Popular 2019”, UCCA is the only private art museum in China on the lists. This paper takes UCCA Center for Contemporary Art as an example, using web text analysis from audience comments on Dianping.com, combined with UCCA’s goal to analyze its micro-strategy, transformation of strategies, and the effects of transformation. Moreover, this paper reveals the changes in visitors’ focus and remaining problems of UCCA before and after COVID-19. Studying museum visitors based on acquiring data from social media is valuable and necessary since this method is efficient for obtaining data with the help of digital tools, and not affected by physical restrictions, namely the pandemic. The paper also provides a method for art managers to replicate the study that can be used for analyzing their institutions.</p>
<p>The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the methodology applied. Section 3 and 4 are results of the analysis and discussion. Section 5 discusses the limitations of this study and future research improvements.</p>

<p><em>Figure 1.</em> The interface after uploading the comments corpus on Voyant.</p>
<p>Voyant is a user-friendly and versatile web-based application for performing text analysis, which is valuable for interpretative research to extract informative evidence through high-frequency terms, relative trends, and frequencies (Miller, 2018). It is employed for quantitative analysis of qualitative marketing data (Hetenyi et al., 2019), extracting useful information, obtaining new insight from patient experience comments (Maramba et al., 2015), and conducting literature analysis (Hodhod &amp; Fleenor, 2018). Nonetheless, Voyant has some drawbacks. It can be affected by network conditions, causing that many functions are missing or cannot be customized. However, it makes research feasible with the minimal time consumed and does not require users to have coding expertise, making it still a good supplementary tool for the average humanities scholar (Welsh, 2014).</p>
<p>Voyant has twenty-four tools to visualize the features of each document, or differences and relationships among several documents (Miller, 2018). Five tools were presented in Figure 3 (Cirrus, Summary, Trends, Reader, and Bubblelines) after uploading the comments corpus consisting of two documents. For trends analysis, all documents were analyzed as a whole and in two periods separately. This paper attempts to demonstrate the results by using the seven methods below, which are interconnected for verifying the results of each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document Terms (a table view of term frequencies for each document)</li>
<li>Summary (an overview of the current corpus)</li>
<li>Trends (a visualization of the frequencies of terms across documents in a corpus)</li>
<li>Mandala (a visualization of the relationships between terms and documents)</li>
<li>Bubblelines (terms frequency and distribution in a document)</li>
<li>MicroSearch (frequency and distribution of terms in a document)</li>
<li>The Contexts/ Keywords in Context (surrounding text of keywords)</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm4573o">Data Acquisition</h5>
<p>The author collected data manually from Dianping.com, a public reviews net that hosts consumer reviews of restaurants, shops, and various institutions, which is similar to Yelp and TripAdvisor. Considering the research scope is comments analysis, this study excludes users’ privacy and personal information, such as names and ages. In total, 3178 comments on Dianping.com were acquired. After deleting invalid comments unrelated to UCCA, 3154 valid comments were recorded. The time scale of this study is from January 13<sup>th</sup>, 2010, when the first comment of UCCA was published on Dianping.com, to August 4<sup>th</sup>, 2022 when this study started to collect data. Although the official COVID-19 outbreak time is December 1<sup>st</sup>, 2019 when the first patient infected was discovered in China. On January 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020, UCCA published news about closing door because of COVID-19, so the time division should be January 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020 since after that day, the comments of UCCA are related to the pandemic. Therefore, this corpus was also divided into two Microsoft Excel documents. The numbers of comments are 1563 and 1591 respectively, before and after COVID-19.</p>

<p><em>Figure 3.</em> The corpus after cleaning in OpenRefine.</p>
<p>At this stage, cleaning data is needed. In Chinese, some punctuations are different from English. Such as the comma is “,”, and the full stop is “。”. Some punctuations are unique, for instance, “《》”, “、”, “——”, and “[]”, etc. (Figure 1). Besides, Chinese visitors combined multiple symbols to convey special feelings, such as “~”, “*”, “!?!?”, “????”, and emojis. Some Text Analysis tools designed for analyzing English corpus cannot identify these non-English symbols. Therefore, to ensure the accuracy of the analysis results, this paper uses OpenRefine, an open-source desktop application for data cleanup, to remove useless punctuations and symbols (Figure 2). After cleaning, the total words of the comment corpus are 265,961 compared with 306,181 words before.</p>

<p>In the Chinese language, there are different expressions to express the same meaning. For example, “展览”, “展”, and “画展” all mean “Exhibition” in the English language. After obtaining the top 100 words from the Document Terms tool, the author summarized them into 80 words. Figure 4 reveals the high-frequency terms overall corpus. “Exhibition” was mentioned the most, followed by “Art”, “Artwork”, and “Artist”. The audience cared more about the whole situation than the details. Among these terms, some refer to exhibition names and artist names③. Compared with other exhibitions in UCCA, “Picasso: Birth of a genius” was discussed the most, which means this exhibition is the most prominent one among all exhibitions, and it may also have had a pivotal influence on the popularity of UCCA in the 798 Art District and China.</p>

<p>Some terms have reflected visitors’ purposes for going to UCCA and the points of attention for them in exhibitions, namely taking photos (photograph), buying art derivatives (buy), appreciating artworks (appreciation), learning from explanation (explain), and experiencing the “aura” in artworks and exhibitions (feeling and experience), etc. While some are complaints, such as some content cannot be understood (not understand), waste of time for queuing (queue), ticket prices or art derivatives were too expensive (expensive), and too cold because of the air conditioner (cold), and so on. From the relative top terms, it is clear to know what visitors’ real concerns are and what aspects need to improve for UCCA.</p>
<h5 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm4573u">Trends of ticket price</h5>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/Figure-6.jpg" alt="" width="681" height="391" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-6-xs.jpg 300w ,https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-6-sm.jpg 480w ,https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-6-md.jpg 768w ,https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-6-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-6-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-6-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure>
<p><em>Figure 6. </em>Relative frequencies of numbers.</p>
<p>Except for the attraction of art, visitors talked about “Ticket” 881 times (Figure 4), including a number of comments complaining about the high prices of tickets. In Figure 4, the numbers collected, namely 100, 60, 103, and 15 may refer to ticket prices. Thus, the prices need to be extracted and verified in another way. The author used the Context Tool to search “元” (Chinese Monetary Unit), “票” (Ticket), and “票价” (Ticket Price), then collected the numbers around these three words. Prices are mentioned by visitors in the comment corpus from the lowest at 10 RMB to the highest at 190 RMB (Figure 6). Most high prices set before were cut down now, and 100 RMB became the main price, while 15 RMB was the majority price before. Among these numbers, some refer to the same exhibition. For example, one exhibition has three different prices for students, children, and the elderly.</p>
<h5 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm4573v">Relative frequency of selected terms</h5>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/Figure-7.jpg" alt="" width="1300" height="1300" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-7-xs.jpg 300w ,https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-7-sm.jpg 480w ,https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-7-md.jpg 768w ,https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-7-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-7-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/media/posts/7/responsive/Figure-7-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure>
<p><em>Figure 7.</em> The relationships between terms and documents.</p>
<p>Figure 7 presents the relationships between selected terms and the documents. Each search term pulls documents toward it based on the term's relative frequency in the document. From the relative distance, it is obvious to see the changes of focus of visitors. Photographs and interpretation are concerned during both periods, and photography is also one of the features of UCCA. The exquisite design and decoration of exhibitions have attracted plenty of visitors, especially the young. Before COVID-19, the audience cared more about the content of exhibitions as well as the physical environment (Exhibition Hall). While nowadays, they tend to focus on their feelings, emotions, and the atmosphere in exhibitions, which means that the demands of visitors are getting more abstract.</p>
<p>In addition, UCCA had a strong connection with the 798 Art District. Among these comments, another significant difference is the relative frequency of "798" and “UCCA”. In the past, and visitors mentioned "798" more than "UCCA". Because some visitors came to the 798 Art District to travel and then visited UCCA passing by. Or some went to visit UCCA because there were also many other entertainments, such as coffee shops, book stores, and restaurants nearby as a combination of tourist destinations. However, with time passing by, people tend to mention UCCA more than 798 Art District, which reveals that the audience focused on the UCCA itself more. Nowadays, as a symbol of the 798 Art District, its uniqueness becomes more and more acceptable. Therefore, it is necessary for art institutions to take into account the geographic benefits. Meanwhile, fast self-development is also a priority.</p>
<p>Due to dividing the complete and coherent corpus with contextualized meaning into numerous smaller words and phrase units (Krippendorff, 2018), there was an issue with Voyant in the process of analyzing the Chinese corpus. For example, in the Chinese language, except for using “no” and “not” directly to convey negation, there is plenty of different expressions used in the context that can have the same meaning, which cannot be recognized by Voyant and other analysis tools. It cost more time and consideration for a non-English Digital Humanities research project than for an English project.</p>

<p>While many museums and galleries were keeping their old style, UCCA has already adjusted its direction to the outside changes, and it carried out efficiently. After COVID-19, visitors cared for their inner demands more than before because their comments contained a lot of “Think”, “Feeling”, and “Meaning” (figure 10, 11, 12), which was affected by the pandemic. UCCA’s first exhibition after COVID-19 is “Meditations in an Emergency”. The purpose of this exhibition is to comfort people, provide them with a chance to reflect, and recall their cohesion via art. The exhibition’s name comes from a poem written by Frank O’Hara. “In times of crisis, we must all decide again and again whom we love”. When the pandemic occurred, UCCA reacted immediately and showed their inclusion and responsibility for society and people powerfully. Except for that exhibition, UCCA also curated many exhibitions that are related to the times and people, such as “Immaterial / Re-material: A Brief History of Computing Art” and “Mirage: Contemporary Art in Augmented Reality” for exploring the relationship between humans and technologies. “Cao Fei: Staging the Era”, “Wang Tuo: Empty-handed into History”, and “Liu Xiaodong: Your Friends” was all about how humans reacted in different eras.</p>

<p><em>Figure 11.</em> The frequency and distribution of terms: “Banana” and “Judgement”.</p>
<p>As for advertising strategies, in each exhibition, UCCA finds a stunt and magnifies it. Such as “the most famous artwork”, “the biggest exhibition yet”, “the first exhibition”, or “the most expensive artwork”, and other descriptions that sound rare. In figures 10 and 11, each selected word is represented as a bubble, and the size of the bubble indicates the word’s frequency in the document. The larger the bubble is, the more frequently the word occurs. During the exhibition “The last judgment”, the highest count term is “Banana”, which refers to an expensive artwork called “Comedian” created by Maurizio Cattelan, a real banana bound on the wall by a tape. And “Comedian” was sold for 12 million dollars in 2019. Thus, the distinctive term “Tape” was mentioned 34 times (Figure 5). The “Cake” refers to a banana cake designed by Holiland, one of the most popular cake brands in China. UCCA cooperated with it to sell banana cakes that were very similar to the “Banana” created by Cattelan, which was a good way to generate revenue. Another example is “Picasso: Birth of a genius”, the first Picasso exhibition in China. Visitors mentioned 294 times “真迹” (Authentic work), proving that they cared about the authenticity of the artwork, and were eager to become one of the first watchers of Picasso’s exhibition in China. Many people have been attracted by the stunts highlighted by UCCA on purpose.</p>

<p>Expensive tickets are hard to keep the audience. Thus, UCCA encouraged people to join in UCCA club by offering them another more “economical” plan, which is also a good way to nurture regular customers. In order to see the changes in prices, the author separated the decreased prices and the increased prices. The trends in Figure 11 show that UCCA narrowed down choices of ticket prices, and adjusted tickets at a price of 100 RMB mainly. A membership costs 500 RMB for an adult, and 800 RMB for a couple per year, including visiting all exhibitions except special programs. From comments, massive visitors introduced others to join in UCCA club because they thought UCCA membership was very cheaper than buying tickets separately. If a visitor could visit UCCA more than 5 times a year, joining membership is more economical. But at the same time, the original prices are still not cheap. UCCA just provided another seemly better choice for the audience.</p>

<p><em>Figure 15.</em> The frequency and distribution of terms: “Body guard”, “employees”, and “workers”.</p>
<p>In both periods, the impolite attitude of employees especially of bodyguards, and feeling too cold inside exhibition halls are mentioned many times. In figures 14 and 15, each document in the corpus is represented as a vertical block where the height of the block indicates the relative size of the document compared to others in the corpus. The location of occurrences of search terms is located as red blocks. In figure 14, the problem of cold has been improved after COVID-19 because the red points decreased a lot, namely fewer complaints about that issue. However, in terms of workers’ attitudes, red points spread regularly in both documents, which means that UCCA had not taken measures to solve this problem, or its solutions did not work too much. From the perspective of the audience, UCCA’s employees need to improve their work profession and attitude. This problem may be caused by the reason that many workers are volunteers or interns, thus, their performance cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1gcdkm45744"><strong>CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</strong></h4>
<p>This research used web text analysis to understand visitors’ experience in UCCA based on comments from Dianping.com, and analyzed UCCA’s strategies and problems. As a result of the analysis, it shows that when the outside environment and demands of the audience change, it is also necessary for art institutions to switch their strategies, especially in the post-pandemic era. This article demonstrates a new way for art managers to understand museum visitors. The method can be replicated by researchers to analyze their own institutions. Meanwhile, researchers should conduct longitudinal studies to observe changes in visitor experiences because the visitors are changing in ages, mindsets, and preferences over time (Black, 2015).</p>
<p>There are some limitations to this study. Firstly, the data collected is limited by this single data resource of Dianping.com. If time allows, the corresponding research should widely use a variety of social media data, such as Sina Weibo, WeChat, etc. To be more comprehensive to understand the visitors. In addition, this study only focused on web text but excluded some certain categories of visitors, such as kids, the elderly, and people who do not own a smartphone or do not use Dianping.com. Thus, future research could combine online reviews and questionnaires, and quantitative and qualitative analysis to build a more solid foundation for results (Hetenyi et al., 2019). Lastly, Dianping.com is a commercial platform, inevitably, some comments are not objective since it was biased by commercial profits or personal preference, which can influence the results. And the quantity of data can also affect the analysis. Thus, more data resources and more data are needed in the future for obtaining more precise and scientific results.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>This paper takes UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing, China, as an example, using web text analysis from comments of audiences on Dianping.com, combined with UCCA’s goal to analyze its micro-strategy, transformation of strategies, and the effects of transformation. Moreover, this paper reveals the changes in visitors’ focus and remaining problems of UCCA before and after COVID-19. The results show that UCCA used a more economical membership mechanism to establish close relationships with audiences, which made the complaints of high-price tickets less. Before the pandemic, the audience focused on the content of exhibitions, however, after that, the demands of audiences became more abstract and they tend to talk about their feelings and emotions generated from exhibitions. Meanwhile, UCCA switched its exhibition themes to be more related to the times and people to communicate with the audience more deeply. In a post-pandemic era, on-site studies sometimes are restricted in China, while studying museum visitors based on acquiring data from social media is relatively steady. Meanwhile, the paper provides a method for art managers to replicate the study that can be used for analyzing their institutions.</p>
