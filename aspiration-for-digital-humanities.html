I was puzzled while reading his book “Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology”, Postman illustrates his worries about the influence of technology, and the worst situation is that culture takes its orders from technology. Then we live in a TECHNOPOLY world. So, can we find the solution and stop this happen?</p><p>From my experience of working in a Virtual Reality company, I knew the necessity of digitalization, which is providing a choice for people to experience the world from a distant way. After transforming an exhibition that I curated into a virtual one, I found people excited at the beginning, but they would not click the button again. Same as I volunteered for guiding students from remote areas to appreciate an art exhibition exhibited in the capital city of China through a virtual tour. They thought it cool but they did not have an interest in learning the art from it. It seems that these fancy digital experiences were just transient. In the Design Thinking class, I reversed my way of thinking. I investigated my four nieces and nephews about why they wanted to go to museums. Their innocent and simple answer which was "for fun" but not studying was far away from what I thought but reasonable. In retrospect, I focused too much on the performance of technology and ignored the more important views from the outside, namely, what are the audience's real needs.</p><p>According to Christoph Kucklick, we are living in “die granulare Gesellschaft” (the granular society). We could be analyzed by numerous data that can predict our behaviors. Every piece of information that people post online will be part of their identities in the era of data explosion. Nonetheless, this situation is inevitable, we can take control of the purpose of utilizing data. For investigating the strategies of Guardian Art Center, I collected 320 articles posted on WeChat from GAC manually and make them a visualization to evaluate if these actual actions were in accord with its purposes and principles. This is my first time interpreting a problem from a digital perspective which helped me get a 95 score in the Art Museum Planning class. Except for qualitative methods, we can discover new problems and different features which cannot be perceived easily by humans through data or statistics. So that we can improve the existing status and provide more targeted services for visitors.</p><p>While learning Digital Humanities at Oxford University summer school and UCLA Digital Humanities Summer Workshop, I knew a lot about digital tools, such as ArcGIS, OpenLayers, and Voyant. And I attained plenty of information about various projects conducted by scholars from different countries using those tools, such as “Remember Me” in memory of people who died as a result of COVID-19 in the UK. I comprehended an exact definition of Digital Humanities might become a limitation. The points are What concept I am eager to convey. What goal do I want to achieve?  What kinds of digital tools do I need, and how do I benefit from them? After webinars, I focused on studying museum visitors using Web Text Analysis. I taught myself to use Wordless and Voyant which are both applications of Natural Language Processing. For understanding how Natural Language Processing works, I attended a tutorial instructed by computational linguist Jonathan Dunn, and I got a Professional Certificate of Text Analytics with Python after that. All of this knowledge and tools are to help me find the museum visitors’ needs including their negative feedback which is valuable for improvement. Even though doing online research is efficient, information from the internet cannot cover all kinds of people. Thus, qualitative methods are still necessary. On top of that, research should base on ethics.</p><p>The question from the beginning is always on my mind and I think the higher purpose is none other than human-oriented. When I launched a project in the Research Center for Digital Humanities, Renmin University of China. The first and foremost is setting a higher purpose, namely extracting information from social media for finding out what visitors' requirements, then helping museums design better services. On this Art Interactive Map based on WebGIS, users can find descriptions of different art activities in Beijing, then choose their art routes individually. They can also write down their comments below the activity and share them with others. This map will record their tracks and words, which are useful for me to study their characteristic of behavior in time and space. In this group,  we have teammates from diverse majors, such as Archival Science, Museum, Anthropology, Design, and Fine Arts. As an Art Management student, I have gained knowledge of art theory and strategies for management. And also I know how to cooperate with people with colorful personalities since many friends of mine are artists. So, as the group leader, I enable to coordinate and organize our team members effectively. Except for doing research, one of the most meaningful things in this project is learning from their distinctive concepts.</p><p>Postman reminds us of the purpose of using technology by criticizing technology sharply. In the last chapter of the book, he has told us the way to face TECHNOPOLY. Namely, joining art and science as well as the past and the present to create a continuous story of humans, aiming to achieve “the ascent of humanity”. If only choose one word to describe myself, I would say “iteration”. I always reflect on what I did, learn from the past and readjust myself. This consistent “program” of mine can help me conduct my academic research and achieve my goal of being a Digital Humanist in the future, and to solve human problems using digital tools with human-oriented and trying to be one of the “The Loving Resistance Fighters”. Last but not least, bear in mind the higher purpose forever.</p><p> </p><p>If you have any advice or interest in my "personal statement", please contact me. 😊 </p><p class="msg msg--highlight msg--info">WeChat: CXY-108801</p><p class="msg--highlight msg--info msg">Email: <a href="mailto:cxyamalia@gmail.com">cxyamalia@gmail.com</a></p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 1, 2022</p><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Famalia6767.github.io%2Fxingyi%2Faspiration-for-digital-humanities.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Famalia6767.github.io%2Fxingyi%2Faspiration-for-digital-humanities.html&amp;via=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FEureka6767&amp;text=Aspiration%20of%20Digital%20Humanities%3A%20Being%20a%20Loving%20Resistance%20Fighter" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famalia6767.github.io%2Fxingyi%2Faspiration-for-digital-humanities.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/authors/xingyi-chen/" rel="author">Xingyi Chen</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/metamuse-a-museum-in-metaverse.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> METAMUSE: Museum in Metaverse</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Tutored by Dr. Wendy Perla Kurtz (wpkurtz@ucla.edu / @WendytheDH) </p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://amalia6767.github.io/xingyi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
